We are into the denial management step of **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** right after the payment was posted by the Payer. We want to have an overview of denial claims before resubmitting them. For this, we are analyzing three denial rates: **Claim Denial rate (CDR)**, **Revenue Denial Rate (RDR)** and **Recoverable Revenue Denial Rate (RecRDR)** over Payer and Department. By doing this, we will be able to show which Payer or Department is making us lose the most money, where we can get Return of Investment fast, and where our coding team and billing are making a lot of mistakes.
